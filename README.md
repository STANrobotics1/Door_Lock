STAN Repository for the Triangulating Knocking Door Lock

This lock is a modification of the instructable (http://www.instructables.com/id/Secret-Knock-Detecting-Door-Lock/)
featuring a single sensor. Our modifications have allowed for the triangulation of a knock
based on the locations of three piezo sensors.

THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY UNDER REVISIONS AND IS NOT COMPLETE.

When complete, 'lockserial.py' will allow for a user to be notified any time
their door has been unlocked or incorrectly attempted 3 or more times. Username and password
fields should be filled in with a working gmail account and password in the respective
locations.

In addition, we are in the process of adding photo-verification and RFID functionality. The automated photo capture will
send a photo of the entering person as an attachment to the previously described email and the RFID will give more 
information about who enters the room.

Enjoy!
